Fergus Engineer exam - Alex
Time taken: 3 hours 15 mins (including deployment to netlify)


Notes:
You can view this in action on https://capable-cobbler-1bb580.netlify.app/

Application starts with a mocked array of jobs returned by simulated request/response endpoints 
as I chose to complete the front end section a bit more in depth. 
When you refresh the page the initial state is returned. 
No state management framework in play here, this is intentional to save time.
